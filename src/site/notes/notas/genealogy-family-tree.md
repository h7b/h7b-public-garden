# Genealogy and Family Tree Generator Software

## The Ahnentafel genealogical numbering system

source: [englishancestors.blog](https://englishancestors.blog/2020/08/01/the-ahnentafel-system/)

‘Ahnentafel’, meaning ‘ancestor table’ in German, is an ascending numbering system for ordering and identifying ancestors.

Pros:
- the correct number can easily be allocated to an ancestor
- This arrangement of numbers applies to everyone’s tree in the same way

Cons:
- Starting with the Subject of the tree (i.e. you, or the person/ descendant whose ancestry is being shown) and working backwards, every direct ancestor is given a number.
- Vnese parents like mine do not agree on counting them as the Subject (number 1 on the chart) and works backwards through generations.
- the arrangement on the Ahnentafel numbering system will be completely different if we change the person Subject, i.e. if you’re working on your cousin’s tree, the arrangement of numbers will not necessarily be the same

## A pedigree family tree

A pedigree is a map that depicts the different members of a family and their connections. It is a graph, and it makes assessing who is connected and their relationships — such as parent, sibling, cousin — apparent by visual inspection. [^1]

A pedigree can also help determine how a trait or condition might be passed down through the generations and what might accompany it. [^2]

    - the free version ("Essentials") is pretty powerful. Once you have everything in a genealogical program, you can export to GEDCOM (the standard data interchange format for genelogical programs) or create a variety of report. [^3]

# Taking notes in public - mes belles lettres

This repo contains the source code of my public notes.

Current build:
- The statci site is published using the [Digital Garden Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) and deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- Notes are plain *Markdown* files, written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), located in an appropriate directory inside this GitHub repo (e.g. `journal` for periodic notes, `blog` for long form article, ...).
- Each *Markdown* file has a *yaml* frontmatter for storing metadata.

Published pages are accessible at [kool.casa](https://kool.casa/).

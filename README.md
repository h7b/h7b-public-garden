# Taking notes in public

This repo contains my public notes written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), then published using the [Digital Garden Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) and deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Published pages are accessible at [kool.casa](https://kool.casa/).
